**TrackpadTest** is an experimental project that aims to implement a Unity
native plugin to capture absolute touch positions on MacBook trackpads.

Please note that MultitouchSupport is a private (undocumented) API. It may
break in future macOS versions. Apps using it may be rejected during the App
Store approval process.
